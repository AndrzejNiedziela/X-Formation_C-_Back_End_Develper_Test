RECRUITMENT TEST (C++/BACK END DEVELOPER)
Instruction: Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability
and return your solutions to X-Formation for review.
Note: (*) indicates an extra task that is not required

1. There are at least 4 different bugs in the implementation of the
following Array class. For at least 2 of them could you please:

I. Provide a test case for each bug.
II. Propose a fix for each bug (please provide us with fixed implementation in
array.h file).
III. (*) Assuming we have a bug-free implementation of Array class, do you
think there are any design problems with it?

#include <new>
#include <cstddef>
using std::nothrow;
template <class T>
class Array
{
private:
T *m_pData;
unsigned int m_nSize;
public:
Array(unsigned int nSize) : m_nSize(nSize)
{
if(m_nSize > 0)
m_pData = new (nothrow) T[m_nSize];
}
virtual ~Array()
{
if(m_pData != NULL) delete m_pData;
}

bool Set(unsigned int nPos, const T& Value)
{
if(nPos < m_nSize)
{
m_pData[nPos]= Value;
return true;
}
else
return false;
}
T Get(unsigned int nPos)
{
if(nPos < m_nSize)
return m_pData[nPos];
else
return T();
}
};

2.

Consider the following physical data model:

Write an SQL query that:
I. Selects names of all buildings in Poland.
II. Selects countries where a total number of inhabitants (population) in
all the cities is greater than 400.
III. (*) Selects names of countries that have no buildings at all.

Notice
Please write code in separate files. We would very much appreciate it if you follow these guidelines
on file naming conventions when providing you answers:
•
•
•

array.h and array_test.cpp for the answers to #1 task, with the first one involving fixed
implementation and the second one testing the ability to fix bugs
queries.sql for the answers to #2 task
*.txt or *.md for any documentation, comments, explanations or discussion regarding the
tasks done

For your best convenience, please deliver your answers via private gist (gist.github.com). To do
this, simply create one, create files with answers and share the link with us. If you prefer more
traditional methods, you may want to just archive them and send to us as an attachment to email.
